The purpose of this software is to enhance support ticket tracking for software development teams and enable better communication and organization during the development process. This application is developed using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. And can be decomposed further into components such as client data, ticket data, login controller, user portal controller, ticket handler, timer component, user portal component, dashboard component, ticket component and log in component. 

## Model 
The model component serves as the backbone of the system, overseeing the management of data and all associated operations. Specifically, in this system, its components pertain to both account and ticket data, stored on a database.

## View
The View component is responsible for defining and managing the presentation of data to the user. In this module frameworks were used for enhanced user experience. Within this system, its components include the Dashboard, Ticket, and Login features, which will be hosted on a web hosting service.

## Controller
The Controller component is responsible for managing user interactions, such as key presses and mouse clicks, and then forwarding them to the Model and View components. Within this system, its sub-components consist of the Login Controller, User Portal Controller, Ticket Handler, and Timer Component, which will be hosted on a web hosting service.
